# React Boilerplate

This is a base template for starting a React / Redux application.

This boilerplate sets up [Webpack], [Babel], [React], [Redux], [React Router],
[React Simple Router], [Hot module replacement], [Mocha], [ESLint], SASS, and
basic asset management.

[Webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/
[Babel]: http://babeljs.io/
[React]: https://facebook.github.io/react/
[Redux]: https://github.com/rackt/redux
[React Router]: https://github.com/rackt/react-router
[React Simple Router]: https://github.com/rackt/redux-simple-router
[Hot module replacement]: https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform
[Mocha]: https://mochajs.org/
[ESLint]: http://eslint.org/

## Usage

1. `git clone ... && rm -rf .git && git init`
2. `bin/setup`

## Testing

Tests are written using [Mocha] and [Chai]. Instead of having a dedicated test
directory,the tests are created in an adjacent directory to the file being
tested called `__tests__`.
